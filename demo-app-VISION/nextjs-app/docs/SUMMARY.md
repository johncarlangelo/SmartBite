# SmartBite System Documentation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the SmartBite system, covering all major components and their interactions.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Application
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism design
- **Features**: 
  - Drag-and-drop image upload
  - Real-time image preview
  - Dark/light mode toggle
  - History tracking with localStorage
  - Animated UI components
  - AI-powered recommendations engine

### 2. AI Processing
- **Runtime**: Ollama local AI service
- **Model**: LLaVA 7B vision model
- **Functionality**: 
  - Image analysis for dish identification
  - Ingredient extraction
  - Nutritional information calculation
  - Recipe generation

### 3. Caching System
- **Mechanism**: SHA-256 image hashing for duplicate detection
- **Storage**: SQLite database with better-sqlite3
- **Benefits**:
  - Instant results for previously analyzed images
  - Reduced AI processing load
  - Consistent results for duplicates

### 4. API Endpoints
- **Check Cache**: `/api/check-cache` - Determines if image has been previously analyzed
- **Analyze Image**: `/api/analyze-image` - Processes images with AI and caches results
- **Recommendations**: `/api/recommendations` - Generates personalized dish recommendations using AI

### 5. Database
- **Type**: SQLite
- **Schema**: Single `analyses` table with image hash, analysis data, and timestamps
- **Location**: `data/analyses.db` file

## Data Flow

1. **User uploads image** through UI
2. **Cache check** - SHA-256 hash generated and checked against database
3. **Cache hit** - Return cached results instantly
4. **Cache miss** - Send to Ollama for AI analysis
5. **AI processing** - LLaVA model analyzes image and returns structured data
6. **Result display** - Show analysis to user
7. **Caching** - Store results in database with image hash
8. **History** - Save to user's history in localStorage

## Key Features

### Performance
- **Duplicate Detection**: SHA-256 hashing ensures identical images are recognized regardless of filename
- **Instant Loading**: Cached results load immediately without AI processing
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during AI analysis
- **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions based on user patterns

### Consistency
- **Guaranteed Results**: Same image always produces identical analysis
- **Cross-Device Access**: Cached results available from any device accessing the application
- **Persistence**: Results survive browser cleanup
- **Personalized Experience**: Recommendations adapt to user preferences over time

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode with localStorage persistence
- **History Tracking**: Save and revisit previous analyses
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery options
- **AI Recommendations**: 4 types of personalized dish suggestions
  - **Similar Dishes**: Based on analysis history
  - **Healthier Alternatives**: Better nutritional options
  - **Seasonal Picks**: Current season's best dishes
  - **Perfect Pairings**: Complementary sides and drinks

## Deployment Options

### Local Development
- Runs on developer machine
- Ollama service required locally
- Ideal for personal use and development

### Server Deployment
- Publicly accessible web application
- PM2 process management recommended
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL support
- Docker deployment option available

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- Ollama with LLaVA model
- 8GB+ RAM recommended
- 20GB+ disk space

## Security

- **Local Processing**: All AI processing happens locally
- **No External Services**: No data sent to external APIs
- **Data Isolation**: Analysis data contains no personal information
- **Access Control**: No authentication required for local use

## Recent Updates

### AI Recommendations Engine (October 2025)
- **New Component**: `AIRecommendations.tsx` for intelligent suggestions
- **New API**: `/api/recommendations` endpoint with 4 recommendation types
- **Database Enhancement**: Methods for pattern recognition and history analysis
- **Smart Prompts**: Engineered prompts for high-quality AI responses
- **Beautiful UI**: Animated cards with category tabs and visual indicators

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Caching**: Cache expiration and invalidation for recommendations
2. **Distributed Storage**: Redis or other distributed caching solutions
3. **Image Preprocessing**: Normalize images before hashing
4. **Analytics**: Track usage patterns and popular dishes
5. **Component Restructuring**: Break down large page component into smaller modules
6. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test suite
7. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
8. **Recommendation Learning**: Machine learning for better suggestion accuracy
9. **User Feedback**: Like/dislike system for recommendations
10. **Dietary Filters**: Vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free recommendation options

## Technical Debt

1. **Large Component**: The main page component is quite large and could be broken down
2. **Database Schema**: Simple schema may need expansion for advanced features
3. **Error Handling**: More robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Monitoring**: Limited monitoring and logging capabilities

## Conclusion

SmartBite provides a complete solution for food image analysis with a focus on performance through intelligent caching. The system combines modern web technologies with local AI processing to deliver a seamless user experience while ensuring consistency and efficiency.
