# AI Recommendations Engine - Feature Documentation

## üéØ Overview

The AI Recommendations Engine is an intelligent feature that leverages Ollama AI to provide personalized dish suggestions based on user behavior, preferences, and context. This feature enhances user engagement by making SmartBite a proactive food companion rather than just a reactive analysis tool.

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **You Might Also Like** (Similar Dishes)
**Purpose**: Suggest dishes based on user's analysis history and taste patterns.

**How it works**:
- Analyzes recent and saved analyses from localStorage
- Identifies preferred cuisines (most frequently analyzed)
- Calculates average calorie range preferences
- Uses Ollama AI to generate 6 personalized recommendations
- Each recommendation includes a match score (70-95%)

**User Experience**:
- Automatically shows when user has analyzed at least one dish
- Updates dynamically as user analyzes more dishes
- Diverse suggestions (not all from same cuisine)

### 2. **Healthier Alternatives**
**Purpose**: Suggest healthier versions or alternatives to the currently analyzed dish.

**How it works**:
- Takes the current dish's full analysis (nutrition, ingredients, cuisine)
- Requests AI to find dishes with:
  - 15-30% fewer calories
  - Better macronutrient balance
  - Healthier cooking methods (grilled vs fried)
  - More vegetables/lean proteins
- Generates 4 healthier alternatives

**User Experience**:
- Only available when a dish is currently analyzed
- Each suggestion explains what makes it healthier
- Maintains satisfaction while improving nutrition

### 3. **Seasonal Picks**
**Purpose**: Recommend dishes perfect for the current season.

**How it works**:
- Detects current month automatically
- Maps month to season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)
- Identifies seasonal ingredients for that season
- Generates 5 dishes featuring seasonal produce
- Considers weather-appropriate comfort levels

**Seasonal Mappings**:
- **Winter** (Dec-Feb): Root vegetables, squash, citrus, warming spices
- **Spring** (Mar-May): Asparagus, peas, strawberries, fresh herbs
- **Summer** (Jun-Aug): Tomatoes, berries, corn, stone fruits
- **Fall** (Sep-Nov): Pumpkin, apples, mushrooms, sweet potatoes

**User Experience**:
- Always available (no prerequisites)
- Changes automatically with seasons
- Evocative descriptions of seasonal appeal

### 4. **Perfect Pairings**
**Purpose**: Suggest complementary items to enhance the current dish.

**How it works**:
- Analyzes current dish's flavor profile and cuisine
- Generates 5 pairings:
  - 2 side dishes
  - 2 beverages (wine, tea, cocktail, juice)
  - 1 dessert
- Explains pairing rationale (complements/contrasts)
- Respects cuisine traditions

**User Experience**:
- Only available when a dish is currently analyzed
- Helps complete a full meal experience
- Specific pairing explanations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

4. **Specific Rules**: Guide AI with constraints (calorie ranges, diversity)
5. **Temperature Control**: 
   - 0.3 for analysis (accuracy)
   - 0.7 for recommendations (creativity)

### Example Prompt (Similar Dishes)
```
You are a food recommendation AI. Based on user's recent dish analyses, suggest 6 dishes they might enjoy.

Recent dishes: Pizza (Italian, 450 cal), Tacos (Mexican, 380 cal)
Preferred cuisines: Italian, Mexican, Asian
Average calorie range: 300-500 cal

STRICT JSON SCHEMA:
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "dishName": string,
      "cuisineType": string,
      "description": string (why user would like this),
      "reason": string (connection to their history),
      "estimatedCalories": number,
      "estimatedPrepTime": number,
      "matchScore": number (70-95)
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Suggest diverse dishes
- Consider calorie preferences
- Make descriptions appetizing
- Output ONLY valid JSON

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "similar",
    "recentDishes": [
      {
        "dishName": "Pizza",
        "cuisineType": "Italian",
        "ingredients": ["flour", "cheese", "tomato"],
        "nutrition": {"calories": 450, "protein_g": 20, "carbs_g": 50, "fat_g": 15}
      }
    ],
    "offline": true
  }'

# Test Healthier Alternatives
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "healthier",
    "currentDish": {
      "dishName": "Cheeseburger",
      "cuisineType": "American",
      "ingredients": ["beef", "cheese", "bread", "lettuce"],
      "nutrition": {"calories": 550, "protein_g": 30, "carbs_g": 45, "fat_g": 25}
    },
    "offline": true
  }'
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **AI Dependency**: Requires Ollama to be running
2. **Response Time**: Can take 3-10 seconds depending on model
3. **Accuracy**: AI recommendations are estimates, not guaranteed
4. **History Required**: Similar dishes needs at least 1 analyzed dish
5. **No Persistence**: Recommendations not saved, generated fresh each time
6. **Language**: Currently English only

## üí° Best Practices

### For Users
- Analyze diverse dishes to get better "Similar" recommendations
- Try all 4 categories to discover different suggestions
- Use refresh if recommendations don't appeal
- Save dishes you want to try from recommendations

### For Developers
- Monitor Ollama response times
- Implement timeout handling (30s recommended)
- Cache common seasonal recommendations
- Log failed recommendations for debugging
- Test with various dish types
- Validate AI responses strictly
